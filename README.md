# Simple Linear Regression Project

This project demonstrates the use of simple linear regression to predict a student's percentage score based on the number of hours they study.

## Requirements

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
    ```
3. Run the `linear_regression.py` script to see the results:
    ```sh
    python linear_regression.py
    ```

Refer to `Task1_Supervised_ML.ipynb` for the full code and detailed explanation.

## Explanation

This project uses a dataset containing the number of hours studied and the corresponding scores obtained by students. The data is initially explored and then split into training and testing sets. A simple linear regression model is trained using the training set. The model is then used to make predictions on the test set, and the predicted values are compared to the actual values. Finally, the regression line is plotted to visualize the results.
