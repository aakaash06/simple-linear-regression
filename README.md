# Simple Linear Regression Project

This project uses simple linear regression to predict the percentage score of a student based on the number of hours they study.

## Requirements

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Usage

Run the `linear_regression.py` script to see the results.

```sh
python linear_regression.py

Refer to Task1_Supervised_ML.ipynb for full code.

## Data explanation
Contains simple data of hours studied and scores obtained. Data is initially explored. It is then split into train and test. Using this training set to train a simple linear regression model. Make predictions on unseen data and compare it's actual value. Plotting the regression line.
